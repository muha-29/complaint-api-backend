# Node Express API (TypeScript) for Hackathon

This is a simple API sample in Node.js, built with Express and TypeScript. This project was created for a Hackathon.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the server with `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the source code.

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and output it to the `dist` directory.

4.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    This will start the server from the compiled JavaScript code in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
